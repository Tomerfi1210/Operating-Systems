 * Program:    GCD and Primes servers (Socket)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex6a.c -0 ex6a
 * Run: ex6a
 * Input: after passing the data in argument vector:
 * 0 for gcd, 1 for primes, 2 to exit.
 * Output: if 0- the gcd of 2 num entered, if 1- all its primes, if 2- exit.

 * This program has 2 serever- one that calculates the GCD of 2 numbers and the
 * other that breaks a number to its primes (up to 100).
 * the client gets ip and port for both servers through the argument vector,
 * and the servers get a port and connect the client with the servers.
 * user enters a num:
 * if user enters 0- GCD server is activated and 2 numbers need to be entered 
 * and server will return the gcd.
 * if user enters 1- Primes server is activated and 1 number needs to be 
 * entered and the prime factors of that number will return to client.
 * if user enters 2- list is freed and program will end.
 * else- program ends.
 * the data will be sent through the argument vector, and by pressing ^C the 
 * list will be freed and servers will end.
