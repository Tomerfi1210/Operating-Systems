Ex3a: Pipe part a
===============================================================================
In program the father gives birth to five children of each type, meaning
that each child solves the problem on a tower of a given size, when the sizes
will be: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
The children will be sent to Dad through the tube and the tower size they were
asked to solve, and the time
The running they needed to solve the problem.
The father will print the minimum runtime, maximum and average time required
to solve the problem on
Tower size n.
The children will continue to write their information to the standard output,
but the information will reach the father
Through a tube. The children work concurrently during the program.

Ex3b: Pipe part b
===============================================================================
In this program the father makes an array that is filled with random numbers
from 0 to 1000 , then it splits it into 5 parts that each child (5) sorts them
by bubble sort and then the father merges all of them from one array into
another sorted
