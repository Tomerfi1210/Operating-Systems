The program reads the input file and inserts the data into a struct that
holds a 2d-dynamic array.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex0.c -o ex0
Run: ex0 "file"

Input: 	An input file;
      
Output: Returns the row that holds the highest values when checking every cell the row
with the other values in the column. If a row like this does not exist, the program returns -1. 

RunTime: m*n^3 when m is the lines_len array and n is the 2nd array
